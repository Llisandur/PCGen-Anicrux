#	Rage		KEY:Barbarian ~ Rage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.Rage	DESC:You can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting you additional combat prowess. You can rage for %1 rounds per day. You can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in rage, you gain a +%2 morale bonus to your Strength and a +%3 morale bonus to Constitution, as well as a +%4 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you %5 hit points, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and are fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death.|RageDuration|RageStrBonus|RageConBonus|RageSaveBonus|(RageConBonus/2)*TL	BONUS:VAR|RageLVL|BarbarianLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.32

#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Feat File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the feats file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
# Abilities are the newest method for all aspects of class & race abilities. Currently we use hidden feats to emulate
# class and racial abilities. The advent of Abilities allows us to use one standard format for a variety of things.
# Generally Abilities are exactly the same in format as a Feat with the exception of a NEW tag CATEGORY which tells
# PCGen what the ability is to be categoried as - example: My Ability is part of the my_abilities category, So I can add
# points only to the my_abilities allowing very small and restricted lists. Another example would be Fighter Bonus feats.
#
# Feat and ability are used through out this example as they almost the same thing - ABILITY can also be used to add "Feats"
# using the CATEGORY:FEAT tag.
# You can also use PREFEAT for any CATEGORY:FEAT, for the rest you'll need to use PREABILITY:x,CATEGORY=<category>,Foo,TYPE.Bar (x is the number)
#####1st Example

#####
#Each ability takes one line, just like a feat, and the first field must be the abilities' name. In the Example the name of the ability is My Ability.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names abilities which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat/ability Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the ability/feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Ability/Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a ability/feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.

Krubet		NAMEISPI:YES		CATEGORY:Background		TYPE:Region		VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:A cold nation, Krubet literally sits on top of the world, populated by only the hardiest of men and women.

Lusta Empire		NAMEISPI:YES		CATEGORY:Background		TYPE:Region		VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:The Lusta Empire, while weak in natural resources, is well placed to be a nation of traders and harvesters of spices.

Khalyra		NAMEISPI:YES		CATEGORY:Background		TYPE:Region		VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:A highly insular country, very little is known about them.  Aside from their defense of the Virizia and the trade they engage in with the Volwohr, there is not much contact with the outside world.  Even when it’s people travel outside their country, they remain cloaked, anonymous, even voices disguised to a raspy metallic sound.		TEMPLATE:Regional Affinity ~ Khalyra		SOURCEPAGE:p.3
