#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Feat File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the feats file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example

#	Skill Focus		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.SkillFocus	DESC:You are particularly adept at your chosen skill.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILL|TYPE=Charisma|TYPE=Dexterity|TYPE=Intelligence|TYPE=Strength|TYPE=Wisdom	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving the chosen skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in that skill, this bonus increases to +6.
# The bonus to the skill is in the Skill File, however, you can bonus the skill directly by adding the following:
#	BONUS:SKILL|%LIST|3
# %LIST is a substitution, and then the number is applied to the chosen skill(s).

#####
#Each feat takes one line and the first field must be the feat's name. In the Example the name of the feat is Skill Focus.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names feats which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.
Sutra Caster		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PRESTAT:1,WIS=13		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Religion)=2		DESC:[Not Implemented] You are versed in the lore of sutras, the lessons and principles of your religion. You can write these sutras on sacred strips of paper, called ofuda, to ward away, bind, or even combat infernals and other threats. Some are used as talismans for luck, to temporarily provide magical insight, or to temporarily empower allies.		STACK:NO		MULT:NO		SOURCELONG:Sutra Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.12		SOURCEDATE:01-2010		VISIBLE:YES		BENEFIT:Characters create an ofuda by inscribing the mystic runes of a sutra, also called brilliant jade script, onto the strip of paper (ofuda), which they can then cast. A character begins knowing 1 sutra only. The character can acquire and learn more sutras equal to twice her Wisdom bonus (minimum of 1). If she belongs to a class that is considered to grant sutra caster levels she is limited to learning no more than half her total combined sutra caster levels, whichever is higher. Special: Demon hunters of the Celestial Retribution tradition automatically receive sutra caster as a bonus feat at certain levels; they need not select it. Demon hunters, inquisitors, oracles and paladins may substitute their Charisma bonus for use with this feat when casting a sutra instead of using their Wisdom bonus.
Gifted Omamori		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sutra Caster		DESC:[Not Implemented] Your generous nature rewards your efforts in the forging of omamori for others. You find the making of omamori less of a drain than other sutra casters do.		STACK:NO		MULT:NO		SOURCELONG:Sutra Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.12		SOURCEDATE:01-2010		VISIBLE:YES		BENEFIT:Once per day, when creating an omamori that you then give away to another to bear and benefit from, you do not have to count it against the number of sutras you can cast per day. You must create it at half the effective sutra level that you normally provide to your omamori. For example, if you are a 7th level sutra caster, normally able to create effective 3rd level spell sutras, then once per day, you can create an omamori that is an effective 1st level spell sutra. You then provide it to an ally; and the omamori does not count against the daily number of sutras that you can cast.
Ofuda Specialist		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sutra Caster		DESC:[Not Implemented] You are well-versed in a particular type of ofuda, making them more difficult to resist.		STACK:NO		MULT:YES		CHOOSE:Charm|Punitive|Warding		SOURCELONG:Sutra Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.12		SOURCEDATE:01-2010		VISIBLE:Yes		BENEFIT:Choose one type of ofuda: Charm, Punitive, or Warding. Your sutra caster level is considered to be 1 higher than normal for these type of ofudas that you cast. You gain a +1 bonus to any caster level checks you might have to make with ofudas of that type.
