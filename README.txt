# To use this repot
Load the data into your PCGen's /data/homebrew folder (either by copying the folder or using a symlink)
Open PCGen, and under the Advanced tab for loading sources, find the needed file under Homebrew

- Puddle Zone - This will add just the base compatability tweaks
- Anicrux - This will load the compatability tweaks as well as the Codex (This is the option you're more likely to use)
- Anicrux Unstable - Only used for testing.  Will load Puddle Zone, Anicrux, and any test files loaded in the unstable PCC file.
